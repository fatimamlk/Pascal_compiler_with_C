# Pascal Compiler Written in C

This project was designed to build a Pascal compiler, encompassing the entire process from lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis to the generation of pseudo-code.

Unfortunately, the project remains incomplete. We were unable to implement all the intended grammar rules and did not have the chance to develop the interpreter. The project is open for contributions from anyone interested in completing it.

## Usage Instructions

To use the compiler, simply compile and run the `main.c` file. When executed with the sample Pascal file `test.p`, the output should display the following:

The output includes:
1. The pseudo-code that has been generated.
2. A message confirming that the Pascal test file has successfully undergone lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis and is correctly formatted.
3. A table listing identifiers, including variables, constants, labels, as well as the names of functions and procedures.
